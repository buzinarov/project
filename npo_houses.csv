Available starting Aug. 15, we're looking for a tenant(s) interested in short term (minimum 3 months) rental tenancy with possible term renewals for our master bedroom in our 2 bedroom condo. The other bedroom is already currently rented by another tenant so the kitchen, dining area, living room, and in-suite laundry will be shared spaces. Each bedroom is private with their own bathroom and walk-in closet. Master bedroom is furnished with a large queen bed, table, office chair, and lamps. The shared kitchen, dining area, and living room are furnished too. Monthly hydro utilities (electricity & water), Shaw 300 internet, and 1 reserved underground parking spot are included in the monthly rent. Tenants also have full access to the condo's amenities (gym, hot tub, & rec/meeting room). Great for a tenant(s) who is looking to just move in quickly as everything is provided!

Our condo is high up on the 16th floor of the Fitzgerald building with breathtaking scenes of panoramic southern, western and northern views of Burnaby, the downtown Vancouver city lights, & snow capped North Shore Mountains! The Brentwood location is stunning too as it's a 20 minute drive to downtown Vancouver, walking distance from the Brentwood Town Centre mall, skytrain, bus stops, grocery stores (Save On Foods & Whole Foods), lots of restaurants/cafes, and there's a park on the building's property.

Tired of basement apartments in noisy and polluted neighbourhoods? Then move in next to Confederation Park, a huge green space with lots of sun and shade, quiet and vibrant corners, public BBQs, tracks, tennis/basketball/football courts, public library, indoor swimming pool, etc..

A 95 B-Line bus stop (connecting SFU on Burnaby mountain to downtown) is within short walking distance. The vibrant Hastings street with lots of restaurants, grocery stores, etc is also within walking distance. 

Enjoy your breakfast, dinner and beer in our small garden, which feels like a private extension of the park. You won't be bothered by any traffic or noise whatsoever. The apartment itself is a garden suite (all above ground level) with a very bright kitchen and living room. Your BR (15 sqm = 161 sqft) will be the larger one of two BRs. We share a small but nice bathroom. There is a dead end hallway, which allows for lot's of storage space for sports equipment etc. Washer and dryer are in the garage with direct access from our apartment. The garage also allows for bike storage, but not much more than that. 

I am a German PhD student (27M yrs old) looking forward to a shared living space in which we respect each other and each other's needs. I am happy to be social, but I also have a lot going on and enjoy time for myself. When there is some free time, I play in the outdoors. 
Small pets are ok (I don't have any - but my friends will bring some over every now and then). You can have my king size bed (photo) if you want. We can also rearrange the shared space if you have other ideas and needs.
An individual will pay 1050$ plus share of bills (annual average about 150$ for whole apartment), a couple 1250$ plus shares of bills. Move in preferably in August, beginning of September is also ok.

Please write me an email with a little about yourself and how you picture us living together. Looking forward to you! Flo    "

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

I am taking one of the two bedrooms, and looking for a someone to rent the other room furnished with a single bed that is available as of September 1st. In addition, there is a full size dinner table, big sofa and coffee table in the common area. Rent includes private bathroom, on-site gym facilities, in-suite washer and dryer, dishwasher and gas range stove. 

Rent is $1000 per month including utilities (+ 1/2 internet). Damage deposit of $500 is required. The rental contract is with the homeowner and requires a 1 year (12 months) agreement. Parking stall available for extra cost ($75/month). The homeowner regularly checks on the place but will give necessary notice. This is not a month-to-month rental. If you reply, please understand that.

I am a 22 year-old guy who is quiet, respectful, responsible and clean/organized currently starting my 4th year and originally from Chilliwack, BC. The homeowner posts a cleaning schedule at least a month in advance - pretty much both roommates are responsible in alternate weeks for cleaning the common areas. It is important to me that you have a good personality and open communication (ability to bring up issues and responding to text messages). I am really friendly and like to get to know new people. I prefer that you have experience renting elsewhere and don't feel uncomfortable living with new people.

Looking for a shared roomie, ideally for beginning of Sept., 2019.  This is a clean rooftop flat/apartment on the upper floor of walk-up building.  The apartment is clean and simple, with wooden floors and a shared kitchen, living area, balcony (with nice river view) and bathroom/shower.  You'll have wooden floors and 2 closets. Your room is unfurnished and it would comfortably fit a queen/king bed, working desk; and/or a small sofa/couch.  

The space and proximity to Columbia Street Skytrain Interchange Station (only 5-7min walk) would be suitable for a professional working in Metro Van or a grad/undergrad university/college student.  

Ideally you are able to sign a one year lease, however, I am open to discussing other possibilities.

Looking for ONE responsible, clean and friendly female roommate to share a large, beautiful and spacious brand-new house with six other girls. Roommates are in their mid-twenties and working full-time/students so we are looking for someone who will be quiet/keep to themselves/be respectful of the house environment and will fit in with the other girls. The house is very clean and quiet most of the time because the bedrooms are divided over three floors. Each girl has her own private bathroom so no sharing necessary. There is a cleaning schedule that all the roommates take part in to divide chores/keep the common areas clean. 

NO smoking/vaping. NO pets. For the safety and comfort of all roommates, there is a NO overnight guests policy (you will have to make accommodations for visiting friends and family elsewhere; they cannot sleep overnight in the home). 

All utilities except cable included. Six months is preferred. 

Common areas are furnished. The bedroom is also furnished (large carpet, bed, side table and dresser). It is the master bedroom of the house and has its own heat control, large walk-in closet, and bathroom. The bathroom is equipped with a large shower, jacuzzi, two sinks and toilet. 

Laundry on site. Lots of parking if you drive. Bus stops to two different routes are right by the house and are mere minutes away from three different skytrain stations. 

The house is located in the Metrotown area, in a safe, quiet, and clean residential neighbourhood. It is within 5-10 minutes walking distance to local grocery stores, medical services, gas station, etc.

If you are interested, have any questions or want to set up a viewing time, email or text/call  show contact info
 and tell us a bit about yourself. Are you working? Studying? What is a typical day/routine for you? Do you have guests over often? Do you cook? Please do not simply send us your email addresses or contact information. We will only reach out to those who have taken the time to read the entire ad.

There is a gated, very secure cement area where the main entrance is (around back) where you are welcome to put a small table and chairs if you wish.   

Great for a working professional or student.

We do have children who use the outside space so please keep that in mind 🤗

*If this ad is up, the space is still available. No pets. Street parking.

$720 - All inclusive rent. 1 medium sized, unfurnished room available in a 2 bdr suite for Sep 01, 2019. Laundry available on site.
$360 damage deposit.

Location: G/F suite is located in between Joyce & Patterson skytrain. Very close to BCIT! Nearest supermarkets at Crystal Mall, Metrotown & Kingsway. 
Buses & skytrain close by. 

The place:
This home is intended for quiet, peaceful living, working & relaxing. It's not a party house, guests welcome in good judgment and moderation. The kitchen/living room is already setup, so the space is best suited for someone who doesn't have a lot of home items. No storage area. Shared bathroom with bathtub. Space is for one person (no couples) and myself. 

What I'm looking for:
Looking for someone who is an energetic compliment to the space, someone who has a full-time job or studying, who is calm and understands the importance of quiet/down-time but also knows how to enjoy their life. Someone who is flexible, well-mannered and understanding. Ideally someone who works in film or who understands someone who works in the industry. Someone CLEAN, considerate and respectful, an adult and knows how to clean up after themselves in a communal space. If you drink occasionally, that's fine but no heavy drinkers. Looking for someone who agrees to a one month trial period but is looking for a long-term arrangement. Someone who is comfortable following a bi-weekly cleaning schedule to keep things in order. Someone between the ages of 30-45, if you're younger feel free to contact. Someone who can respect quiet time after 11pm on weekdays. Someone mature, with life experience, who knows how to communicate well in general, and, in times of potential difficulty. Someone who can create a space of balance, harmony and open communication with me.

About me:
I'm 34 year old woman who works in the film & tv industry. My schedule is never the same during the week, and, I work long hours. I consistently work Sunday evenings. I'm usually in bed by a decent hour as sleep & resting is important. I enjoy different kinds of electronic music, so, the person I live with would need to be comfortable with that from time-to-time. I'm clean and would love to live with someone who integrates cleanliness as a discipline.

If interested please reply by email and answer the following questions. I will respond to those who sound like a good match!

1. Age, sex, profession & your working schedule
2. Your intended duration of rental
3. Your phone number
4. Your current situation/ a brief description about yourself or anything you'd like to share    "

**Please only text me about this posting as I can answer texts at work
*if its still up here its available 

2 Bedrooms available in 3 bed room place close to SFU. 


Students are preferred but its not necessary


LGBTQ friendly 


My long time roommate is moving out and I’d like to rent out the two rooms he had.


650 for master bedroom and 600 for regular bedroom. 


Im only looking to have 2 other people move into this space, couples are welcome but we have to split the rent 3 ways.


We split internet and hydro

**Almost all of the furniture will be going besides The TV, its stand, one couch and the kitchen table so please bring some stuff if you want and I'm open to getting new things if you don't like the current ones. 
I’ll be buying furniture if no one else brings any, but not for a while.

1 bathroom

Spacious living room with kitchen attached 

Dining area, balcony and lots of closet space , ( 3 closets in the hall, one walk-in storage room, ALSO a closet in every room. ) 


I’m aiming to rent the spaces to people who share similar living values. I just think it would be nice to feel as comfortable as possible living with other new people.

The main values I have about the space I live in and people I live with are for the common areas to be tidy, there to be a quiet time after a certain hour, also Saturday mornings ( I work very late ) and everyone to talk about things that bug them, with calm assertiveness. 


* all of this is up for discussion if you feel like you want to add or change anything.


Tidy: 

The resting state (ie when its not being used) of counter tops, coffee tables and any table should be clear. The floor of the kitchen be swept every few days, 2 to 3, and we can share vacuuming the living room and hall once a week ( takes about 15mins to do ).


Take out the garbage / recycling weekly and if anyone is going to be drinking alcohol they can keep the empties on the balcony in a special box, I don’t really drink often ( a glass of scotch or a beer on the weekend. ) 


Quiet time: after 10 or 11pm ( what ever we agree on taking everyones schedule into account )  


Most Fridays I’m at work till 3 or 6 am so I need to sleep in on Saturdays. 


Talking about stuff: 

Living with people you don’t know very well yet can be challenging sometimes.  I just need to know that if you have something that makes you feel uncomfortable, you’ll bring it up within 1 to 3 days at most, that same day is best, if people have the energy to hear it. ￼

If talking about your feelings is something brand new to you, this living situation might not be the best option, unless you have confidence you can do it.

I can show you the place on the weekend just give me notice and we can arrange a time for you to come by. 
I have one random day off during the week also.

Please only text me about this posting

Hi. My names AJ. I'm moving up to Burnaby in September (or late August) to begin a masters program at SFU. I'm a US citizen and live in Washington state (about 6 hours from Burnaby). I have hardly even left the state, let alone the country, and the transition I'm most worried about is finding a place to stay when I arrive. 

- Moving to Burnaby sometime next month (August) or September 1st at latest
- Biology MS/PhD student. 29 years old. 
- I have a DOG. She is small (a shitzu mutt), adorable, and very friendly. Potty trained. Hoping to find a dog-friendly home where she won't be lonely while I'm working or at class. I'm a huge animal lover in general. 
- I have 10k saved up and will be working in a lab. Also parents can spot me. So I'll never be late with rent. 
- Hoping to pay less than ~800 a month. 
- Prefer to have roommates around my age who aren't totally anti-social, and don't mind occasionally having some drinks and socializing. As someone moving to a completely new city I'd like to meet some people!
- Need to be near SFU. 20 minute drive at most. 
- I'm very easy going and never get angry or annoyed. Since I live far away we can't meet in person, but I suggest you surf through my facebook and see I'm not a weirdo - https://www.facebook.com/aj.keefe.5 
- I lived in Bellingham for 6 years working on my BS in psych at Western Washington University, and have had many many roommates (probably about 15-20). So I know the drill. 
- I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially but not too often.  

Please let me know! Hoping to sort this housing situation out ASAP to lessen the stress of moving to a new country

- AJ    "

Finding a quality homestay can be difficult.  Most agencies push low-quality housing with tiny, dark rooms, strange rules and awful food.  This can be especially hard for younger students, alone in a new country with limited emotional support.

I offer a family home with spacious rooms, great food, no silly rules, full laundry service, homework help and a supportive host family.

We have 3 small kids, aged 6, 5 and 5 months.  They are well-behaved kids who love having “older brothers and sisters” to play with.  We also have two very small dogs who stay only on one floor.  The language of the house in English.

The house is a huge North Burnaby mansion.  We have 9 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, 4 living rooms, a huge backyard, TV room with big screen and Netlfix, smart home devices and more.

We specialize in caring for students under 21.  We have an 8 month minimum stay.  Guardianship is included in the price.  

With 15 years experience working with international students, we are excellent at understanding the needs of our guests.  I have owned and operated English schools in North America and Asia, run a student agency and I currently manage a network of homestay families around the Vancouver area that similarly specialize in the care of younger students.  If you need housing in Kitsilano, Kerrisdale, South Burnaby, North Burnaby, North Vancouver or elsewhere, please let me know and I will help find you the best, most caring spaces and hosts.

838,Trying to Find a New Space For October or Later,N/A,2-Aug,https://vancouver.craigslist.org/bnc/sha/d/trying-to-find-new-space-for-october-or/6947667838.html,0,,,"

QR Code Link to This Post


Hey everyone,  
My name's Nathan, and I'll be looking to move into a new space no sooner than October 1st. I'm in a very relaxed place at the moment, so I can take my time to find the perfect spot. So I may be trawling through here and the various other Vancouver rental groups for a while, until I find a place that feels right, and fits my needs.

A bit about me:  
I'm a 6'6"" tall, abled, cis, white male, but I’m open and accepting towards LGBTQ+. I'm very liberal. Pro-choice, anti-wage-gap, anti-trump, pro-immigrant, feminist, etc.

I recently got turned onto a healthier lifestyle (Thanks dad!), and have cut out almost all processed and fast food. I've begun to exercise far more often, and consistently, than I have before. I'm on week three, and have lost almost 10 Lbs! Not that I especially needed to, but I was slightly overweight and had a horrible diet.  

Something I should also mention is that I'm on the autism spectrum, but am high-functioning (I hate that term, but it's the quickest way of describing my mental state). In short, that means I can mask very well for short durations, but it is very mentally draining. The more you get to know me the more you'll be able to see through it. My most obvious ""tells"" are staring longer than I realize, getting overwhelmed due to sensory overload, and a minor inability to parse subtle body- and facial-language.

These can lead to myriad issues. Social awkwardness due to staring, the tendency to clam up and shut down physically when I've become overwhelmed, and misunderstanding peoples’ intentions/desires/meanings due to bad body language translation, just to name a few of the more obvious ones.

Personality/Likes:
I'm a big ol' geek. I love gaming and tech, and my favorite video media to consume is animated movies and television. Think Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Bob's Burgers, Archer, Big Hero 6, Zootopia, etc.
Not a huge loud music fan (Refer to sensory overload above), so I very rarely go to parties or concerts. I'm quite the recluse, in fact. Very hermit-ish. I revel in my alone time. Though whether that's a part of my autistic tendencies, or just me being on the extreme end of introverted I cannot say.
I also love to read. I'll usually tear through a novel or three every month. Mostly Sci-fi and Fantasy.

I have a few hobbies on top of my general enjoyments. I'm a creative type, and love to work with my hands. Woodwork, metalwork, sewing, cooking, etc. What I'm fixated on at the moment is building custom PC cases, made with both metal and custom carved wood accents, with different fandoms as themes for different cases. 

As I mentioned, I love to cook, so joining a collective where we each make food contributions to the house would be very rewarding.

I also really love deep conversations and learning new things (I'm currently learning Spanish to prep for a trip to Spain July 2020). So if you like talking about important subjects, I'd love to participate. And please, let me know if I say anything insensitive. I may be very liberal, but I'm still a white, cis male, and it's an ongoing struggle to push back against my ingrained privilege.

What I'm looking for in a place:
Ideally, I want a place where I'd have a decent sized bedroom which can fit a queen bed, desk, chair, computer, multiple bookshelves, a dresser, and some open space for VR/stretching.

It would need to have some good, secure storage space so I can store all my tools and other possessions with peace of mind.

I would also need to be able to use power tools on the property. I'm working towards making my hobbies into a business, and I'd need to be able to carve wood and cut metal without bothering people too much. So that pretty much means a house with a yard and/or shed. This is why an apartment wouldn't work.

As for fellow room/housemates, as I said I'm open to all comers  As long as you're honest, relatively tidy, and respectful of me, my possessions, and my mental needs (needed alone time, etc.) then I'd love to have you as a housemate!

If you happen to be interested in videogames and/or animated media, and would like to game/watch together, that's a bonus!

Also working out. I'd love housemates that would come to the gym with me, or who would all go on big adventures out into the hiking trails around the cities, or go ride bikes through Stanley Park.

Anyways, my budget for rent is $1,000, though that's the maximum. I hope to find somewhere slightly less than that. Hope to talk to a few of you!

TL;DR: I think I'm pretty neat! I need space to use power tools. My budget for a place is $1,000.

P.S: I'm going to be posting this exact message in multiple areas, so don't be surprised to see this copied and pasted elsewhere.    "

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

Hi, my name is Martin, 

I am a private rental agent who has the knowledge and the expertise to maneuver your application through a successful rental. I own two properties myself, so I know and understand how to best approach and speak with landlords to make your application standout, with the added benefits of screening the landlord, avoiding scams, negotiating the rent, and terms of the rental, such as pets allowance, furnishings, move in date etc.

When competing for lower valued rentals ($1000 to $2500 range) you are going up against tens, if not hundreds of applications and competing with other potential tenants. It's time consuming and I know the feeling of disappointment when you submit your application and get a call, if they even take the time to contact you, to let you know that the property is rented out. You didn't even stand a chance, so why did they invite you to look. I am able to position your application in a way landlords will give you the top priority and landlords generally love to deal with a tenant who is represented professionally by a rental agent, because they trust that we screen our clients and provide a higher standard. 

As such, when requested, you will need to provide all the usual information the landlord will be requesting for me to able to satisfy their selection process. 

My fee ranges from $500 to $1500 for finding you a rental property depending on the complexity of the project.

If you are interested you can call or text me  show contact info


My focus areas are primarily North Vancouver and West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver.

Some of my finds include: A house with the perfect backyard for a family that were looking to open a daycare. I've worked with location scouting for films and movies, I've found short term rentals for tourists and visitors that saved them thousands from the hotel fees, and I've found students room and boards and rentals close to universities. My most recent find was for a lawyer who was looking for the perfect home office, and a young couple who were moving out for the first time on their own to start their journey in life. I've also assisted with relocation of employees for several companies. 

Thanks for reading.

Us
This one is important to us, we want to meet great people to join our 'Homies' not just to lay up in their rooms. We're active, organizing fun things each week to do together, movies, beach, events, TV and popcorn, board games nights, Playland, clubbing you get the idea. 
We are 25, 28, 30, two guys and a gal. All working professionals. Clean and tidy. We share chores and space, and help each other out whenever we can. We split internet 150. We like to keep the living room lively with movie nights, music, chatting, etc. There are two other guys living downstairs 22, 23 that come up all the time to hang out and join in. The house is always buzzing. If you want to join in, we want you here. 

We have 2 cats, one of which is very friendly and loves head scratches. The other is a lazy s.o.b. and just sleeps on my bed all day. She's pretty chill too. We're not sure about introducing yet another cat into the house, but if you're awesome and you come with a cat, we'd be happy to discuss. Sorry, no dogs, as per the lease.

We're hoping to add to the squad, with some awesome folks who want to keep the family vibe going.
If this is you, give us a shout and tell us a little about yourself.

Hey!

My name's Michael, I'm 23, and currently a student at Langara. 

I'm looking for a roommate to move in as soon as possible - even today!

The private room isn't furnished except it does have a new memory foam queen mattress. The room also has a projector screen (if you have a projector you can watch movies) and a walk-in closet. 

There is also one bathroom that we share. 

You're free to use the rice maker, blender, oven/stove, toaster oven, microwave, dishes, pots, pans etc whenever. Same for the vacuum. There's coin laundry/dryer in building (update - improved machines no longer require coins. Swipe a card to use machines for MUCH more convenience). 

The location is a 15 second walk to the convenience store & 30 second walk to the library. Is RIGHT outside the metrotown SkyTrain station (20 second walk). There's a couple basketball courts and tennis courts near by as well as the bonsor recreational center. There's a soccer and baseball field with in 6 minute walking distance. There's even a golf course close by!

Of course there is the metrotown mall, 2 or so minute walk away, so you can walk to the movie theatre or food court or super store, or any store for that matter in no time. There's an elevator in the building which is handy. 

My current roommate lived here for 8 months, but she headed out to live with her friends. 

Her loss and your gain! Did I mention this is a penthouse? 

Sure it's also a low rise apartment building, but hey, the funs all the same! 

$715 everything included (internet, hydro etc etc).

If the ad is up, the room is still available. 


If you're interested, email me and we'll set up an appointment. Sooner the better.

Warm regards,
Michael.    "

My Fiance and I are looking to rent a basement suite or house/townhouse as soon as possible. We are both very professional, reliable and responsible. I am a PhD Student at UBC and do my research in Pathology at BC Children's Hospital. He is a certified crane operator. We are quiet and enjoy our time in during the weekends. Non-partiers, non-smokers. We both are very busy with work so we are going to treat our place as a relaxing home and not a dorm...We have one older cat that is very well trained and quiet/shy. He will only go out when we are at home and during the day time. 

Hoping to have a place over 800 sq ft, (2 bedrooms or 1 bedroom one den) and a renovated/new kitchen with stainless steel appliances (we both love cooking and a nice kitchen is a must). I am happy to provide employer references/landlord references and a credit check. Also, I can provide a lot of pet references :) 

We are looking for a place close to the highway/easy access to both Vancouver and the Fraser Valley since he works out that way. New West/Burnaby. 

Feel free to contact me (text/email).

Thanks for your interest!    "
